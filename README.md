# My Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

Organized in a fairly self-explanatory way; `01` has the first day and so on. My main language is Python. I'll try to comment anything that isn't obvious but ultimately I am going for time so please excuse bad code quality. Let's save Christmas!

## Times

| Day # | Part 1     | Part 2     |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Day 1 | `00:02:23` | `00:04:56` |
| Day 2 | `00:03:01` | `00:04:32` |
| Day 3 | `00:03:32` | `00:17:40` |
